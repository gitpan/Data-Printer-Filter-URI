SYNOPSIS
    # In your program:

        use Data::Printer filters => {
            -external => [ 'URI' ],
        };

    # or, in your ".dataprinter" file:

            filters => {
                -external => [ 'URI' ],
            },

    # You can also setup color and display details:

        use Data::Printer {
            filters => {
                -external   => [ 'URI' ],
            }, color => {
                uri_scheme  => 'bright_green',
                uri_host    => 'bold',
            },
        };
